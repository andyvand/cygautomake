2005-08-07  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* automake.in (lang_yacc_target_hook): Use AM_MAKEFLAGS in recursive
	$(MAKE) invocations.
	* lib/am/texibuild.am (?GENERIC_INFO?%SOURCE_SUFFIX%%DEST_SUFFIX%):
	Likewise.
	* lib/am/texi-vers.am (%STAMPVTI%): Likewise.
	* lib/am/remake-hdr.am (%CONFIG_H%): Likewise.
	* Makefile.am (maintainer-check): Check for this.
	Report from Stepan Kasal.

	* m4/mkdirp.m4: Update misleading comment about `mkdir -p .'.
	Prompted by Stepan Kasal.

2005-08-07  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* lib/am/texinfos.am (uninstall-info-am): Call install-info only if
	the $(infodir) exists.

2005-07-31  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* tests/library3.test: Fix a typo which made the test fail.

2005-07-27  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* doc/automake.texi (Linking, Program and Library Variables):
	Suggest reserving -l for third-party libraries.

	* lib/Automake/Variable.pm (require_variables): Mention aclocal's
	search path when suggesting to add a macro in configure.ac.
	People are confused when Automake suggests adding a macro (such as
	AC_PROG_LIBTOOL) that is already in configure.ac.
	* automake.in (require_file_internal): Suggest `automake --add-missing'
	for missing files that can be installed.
	* tests/library3.test: Adjust.

2005-07-27  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* tests/defs.in: When required matches both `*libtool*' and
	`*gettext*', check for both m4 files.

	* doc/automake.texi (Auxiliary Programs): Fix a typo.
	* tests/suffix11.test: Fix a typo.
	* tests/colon3.test: s/EGREP/FGREP/.

2005-07-19  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* tests/instspc.test: Major rewrite to test for many other
	problematic file names, e.g., '$', '"', '('.  Automake and
	Autoconf can't handle many of them, so do not report a failure
	if the usual candidates show up.

2005-07-19  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* Makefile.am (automake, aclocal): Merge the rules.

2005-07-10  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* lib/config.guess, lib/config.sub, lib/texinfo.tex: New upstream
	versions.

2005-07-09  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* lib/install-sh: Use IFS=/ to split directories on /, don't translate
	/ into % as it prevents directory names using %...

2005-07-09  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* doc/automake.texi (Public macros): Typo.
	* aclocal.in: Typo in comment.

2005-07-09  Zack Weinberg  <zack@codesourcery.com>  (tiny change)

	* lib/depcomp: Handle "#line" markers as well as "# " markers in
	"cpp" style, so it can work with newer HP compilers (for their
	ia64 systems).

2005-07-02  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* doc/automake.texi (Public macros) <AM_WITH_DMALLOC>: Reword to
	fix an underful hbox.
	* lib/INSTALL, lib/config.guess, lib/config.sub, lib/texinfo.tex:
	New upstream versions.

2005-07-01  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* m4/python.m4 (_AM_PYTHON_INTERPRETER_LIST): Add python2.5.

2005-06-30  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* automake.in (make_paragraphs): Do not define %TOPDIR%, now that
	lib/am/header-vars.am no longer uses it.
	* lib/am/libtool.am (distclean-am, distclean-libtool): Define
	if TOPDIR_P is true, not TOPDIR.
	Suggested by Stepan Kasal.

	* automake.in (read_am_file): Correctly diagnose comments following
	trailing backslash.
	* tests/commen10.test: New file.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add commen10.test.
	Report from Harald Dunkel.

	* automake.in (scan_autoconf_traces): Scan AC_SUBST_TRACE instead
	of AC_SUBST.
	* lib/am/header-vars.am (srcdir, top_srcdir, top_builddir, INSTALL):
	Do not define, they are AC_SUBST_TRACEd by Autoconf.
	* m4/init.m4 (AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE): Require Autoconf 2.59c.
	* tests/include.test: Call AC_OUTPUT.

2005-06-29  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* lib/mkinstalldirs: Fix support for directory name with spaces if
	`mkdir -p' does not work.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add mkinst3.test.
	* tests/mkinst3.test: New file.
	Report from Noah Friedman.

	* doc/automake.texi (Include, Extending aclocal): Typos.
	Report from Karl Berry.

2005-06-28  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>
	    Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* lib/mdate-sh: Avoid infinite loop with GNU ls when TIME_STYLE is set.
	* tests/txinfo28.test: Set TIME_STYLE.
	Report from Vincent Lefevre and James Youngman.

2005-06-24  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* lib/Automake/Variable.pm (define, _new): Remember the helper
	variable created for the last conditional += on each variable, and
	only append further += in the same condition to this last helper
	variable, not to older helper variables.  This way the order of
	the items appended to the variable is preserved.
	* tests/cond21.test: Adjust.
	* tests/cond38.test: New file.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add cond38.test.
	Report from Ed Hartnett.

2005-06-22  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* tests/aclocal5.test: Adjust to recent CVS Autoconf changes.

	* automake.in (handle_footer): Do not output an unformatted
	definition of SOURCES, it is already done correctly in
	generate_makefile.  This superfluous definition introduced long
	lines in some Makefiles, hence breakages in tools with a limited
	line length.  Report from Mathias Froehlich.

2005-06-11  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* lib/am/texibuild.am (?GENERIC_INFO?%SOURCE_SUFFIX%%DEST_SUFFIX%):
	Fix redirections in previous patch.

2005-06-08  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* lib/am/texibuild.am (?GENERIC_INFO?%SOURCE_SUFFIX%%DEST_SUFFIX%):
	Do not backup any file if makeinfo is not installed.
	* lib/missing (makeinfo): Do not touch a missing info file.
	* tests/txinfo30.test: New file.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add txinfo30.test.
	Report from Bob Proulx.

	* doc/automake.texi (Extending aclocal): Typo.

2005-05-24  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>  (tiny change)

	* lib/am/texinfos.am (.dvi.ps): Add $(am__TEXINFO_TEX_DIR) to TEXINPUTS.

2005-05-15  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	Fix PR automake/461:
	* automake.in (require_build_directory): Canonicalize directories
	with different names, such as `foo/bar' and `./foo//bar'.
	* tests/subobj9.test: Augment to test that.
	Report from Tom Tromey.

	that CHANGELOG is not confused with ChangeLog on case-insensitive
	case-preserving file systems.
	* tests/hfs.test: New file.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add hfs.test.

2004-12-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/mdate-sh: Don't use "set - x`$ls_command /`", as zsh mishandles
	the spaces inside $ls_command.  Problem reported by Loulou Pouchet in
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf/2004-12/msg00074.html>.
	Don't use "set - x"; plain "set x" is enough, and simplifies debugging.

2004-12-05  Toshio Kuratomi  <toshio@tiki-lounge.com>

	* lib/py-compile: Add --destdir switch to py-compile that takes a
	path argument that is not compiled into the file when byte compiling.
	* lib/am/python.am: Use the new py-compile arguments to not include
	DESTDIR in the byte compiled files.
	* tests/python12.test: Test that DESTDIR won't be byte compiled into
	python files.

2004-12-05  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* doc/automake.texi (Clean): Typo.

	* doc/automake.texi: Use @acindex for Autoconf macros, and @vindex
	for variables (@cvindex was previously used for both).  Separate
	these two indices in the output.  Use @code, @file, and @command
	in @cindex lines wherever appropriate so they render nicely.

2004-12-05  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* lib/am/scripts.am (installcheck-%DIR%SCRIPTS): Likewise for scripts.
	* tests/gnits2.test: Change scriptnok.sh to cat its input.
	Report and fix from James Youngman.

2004-11-17  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* aclocal.in (%file_seen): Rename as ...
	(%file_added): ... this, and move it close to add_file(), the only
	function that uses it.

	* m4/python.m4 (AM_PATH_PYTHON): Fix the invocation of
	AC_PATH_PROGS to correctly define PYTHON as `:' when no interpreter
	is found (this worked correctly only when a minimal version was
	passed to AM_PATH_PYTHON).  Report from Stepan Kasal.
	(_AM_PYTHON_INTERPRETER_LIST): Define using m4_define_default,
	so we can easily override the list from the test suite.

	@system_includes instead of filling a unique @dirlist array.
	("MAIN"): Adjust to scan m4 files in @user_includes,

2004-11-06  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	honor -W and --warning.
	($verbose): Remove.
	(trace_used_macros): Do not trace the first arguments of macros

	* tests/defs.in (ACLOCAL): Always use -Werror, to catch Perl
	warnings about uninitialized variables.

	VERBOSE=anything_but_x, always turn on shell traces.

	before using it.  Suppress a warning observable in test/acloca16.test.
	Report from Ralf Wildenhues.

2004-11-01  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* lib/Automake/XFile.pm (lock): Make sure $ENV{'MAKEFLAGS'} exists
	before inspecting it; this fixes "uninitialized value in
	concatenation" diagnostics when flock fails.
	Report from Gary V. Vaughan.

	* aclocal.in: Use strict and -w.  Declare local variables with `my',
	and get rid of `local'.
	(scan_m4_files, add_macro): Reindent these functions while we are
	at it.

	* lib/config.guess, lib/texinfo.tex: New upstream versions.

2004-10-22  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* doc/automake.texi (Libtool Convenience Libraries): Explain how
	to force the linker selection.

	* lib/install-sh: Fix the dirname emulation to ignore trailing
	slashes, i.e., the direname of `a/b/' is `a', not `a/b/'.  This
	caused `install-sh a/b/' to fail.
	* tests/instsh2.test: Augment.
	Report from Пухальский Юрий Андреевич.

2004-10-21  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* automake.in (get_object_extension): The extension to use is know
	by the caller, and cannot be selected by looking only at the
	target name.  Simplify this function to simply conditionally
	prepend $U to the given extension.
	(handle_programs, handle_libraries, handle_ltlibraries): Hard-code
	the extension to use.  This way Automake won't mistake a program
	named `foo.la' as a libtool library.
	* tests/primary3.test: New file.

2004-10-12  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	install-exec-hook, and link to Install.

	* configure.ac: Export @am_AUTOCONF@.
	* tests/defs.in (AUTOCONF): Define as @am_AUTOCONF@, not @AUTOCONF@,
	so the test suite runs `autoconf' and not `missing --run autoconf'.
	* tests/missing.test, tests/missing2.test: Arrange for missing
	to be used in front of autoconf even if the user has exported
	AUTOCONF.  This fixes two spurious failures reported by
	Mark D. Baushke.

	* lib/compile: Handle output.obj in addition to output.o.
	* tests/compile.test: Check for this.

2004-10-11  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* doc/automake.texi (Sources): Typo, reported by Karl Berry.

2004-10-10  Kelley Cook  <kcook@gcc.gnu.org>  (tiny change)

2004-09-28  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* automake.in (handle_languages, define_compiler_variable): Output
	Libtool's --tag= option before --mode=compile, because depcomp use
	--mode=compile as end marker for libtool arguments.
	(define_linker_variable): Likewise before --mode=link, for
	uniformity.
	* tests/pr307.test: Make sure dependency files are updated.  That
	was not the case because depcomp thought `--tag=CC' was the
	compiler to get dependencies from.
	Report from Пухальский Юрий Андреевич.

2004-09-26  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* configure.ac: Require Perl 5.6.

	* aclocal.in (rel2abs): Remove.
	(scan_configure_dep): Use File::Spec->rel2abs instead.

	* tests/compile.test, tests/instsh2.test, tests/instspc.test: Use
	two consecutive spaces in filename instead of one, to catch mistake
	like `echo $val | ...`.

	* lib/Automake/DisjConditions.pm (new): Precompute 'string' and 'conds'
	in place instead of as a side-effect of calling ->string and ->conds.

	transform all template tokens instead of doing as much passes as
	possible token.

	New upstream versions.

	* lib/am/texibuild.am (?GENERIC?%SOURCE_SUFFIX%.html,
	?!GENERIC?%DEST_PREFIX%.html): Use $(X), not ${X}.

	* tests/installdir.test: installdirs-local should appear three times,
	since the change from 2004-07-11 will make it PHONY.

	* lib/am/distdir.am (distdir): Always use $(DIST_SUBDIRS) now
	that it is always defined.  This is less confusing for users
	reading the generated Makefiles.
	* automake.in (handle_dist): Do not substitute DIST_SUBDIR_NAME.

	* lib/am/texibuild.am (?GENERIC?%SOURCE_SUFFIX%.html,
	?!GENERIC?%DEST_PREFIX%.html): Output .htp, and then rename to .html
	on success.  In case the target is a directory, this ensures its
	time stamp is updated and the no files are left over inside.
	* tests/txinfo21.test: Augment to test missing timestamp update
	reported by Akim Demaille.

	* doc/automake.texi (Top level): Rename as ...
	(Directories): ... this, and split into ...
	(Subdirectories, Conditional Subdirectories): ... these.

	(handle_dist, handle_install, handle_all, do_check_merge_target,
	handle_factored_dependencies): Use user_phony_rule before

	it is always defined an phony.
	* tests/cond37.test, tests/condhook.test: New files.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add them.

	* doc/automake.texi (Install): Warn that you should create
	/tmp/staging before installing into it, to avoid security problems.
	* lib/install-sh: Remove support for -b= and -t= options; this
	has been moribund for a decade.
	Add support for -t and -T options (new in coreutils install).
	-c option now does nothing (the default is to copy), for
	compatibility with BSD and coreutils 'install'.
	Fix usage message; it referred to nonexistent variables.
	Don't assume 'lasterr' is unset in environment.
	* tests/instsh2.test: Don't assume that install-sh without -c
	moves (it now copies).  Add tests for new -t and -T options.

2004-06-06  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* m4/tar.m4 (_AM_PROG_TAR): Introduce $_am_tools to work around a

	Report from Nicolas Joly.

2004-06-03  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* tests/defs.in (required=icc): Use `-V -help' instead of
	`-V -dryrun'.  icc 8.0 fails on the latter.
	* tests/depcomp5.test: Require depmode=icc for icc 7.x, and
	depmod=gcc otherwise.
	Report from Ralf Wildenhues.

	* lib/am/clean.am (distclean-generic): Do no

	* NEWS: Make clearer that we do not output partial Makefile.ins on
	error.
	Suggested by Akim Demaille.

	* lib/depcomp (tru64) [libtool]: Use $dir$base.o.d instead
	of $dir.libs/$base.o.d.  Libtool 1.5 causes both to be output,
	and we will clean the second automatically during distclean.
	Using the latter and leaving the former as we did before cause
	"files left in build directory" failures during distcheck.
	Suggested by Nicolas Joly.

	* doc/automake.texi (Built sources example): Explain what
	nodist_foo_SOURCES is (not) useful to, and use it in all the
	examples.
	(Tags): Mention nodist_noinst_HEADERS and nodist_prog_SOURCES.
	Suggested by Akim Demaille.

2004-05-23  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* configure.ac, NEWS: Bump version to 1.8c.

	* configure.ac, NEWS: Bump version to 1.8b.

	* m4/tar.m4 (_AM_PROG_TAR) <cpio>: Specify -o and -i option first,
	by POSIX; and use option -d in am_untar.

	* tests/defs.in (PATH): Export it.

	* lib/am/multilib.am: Add $(MAKE) comments to multido and
	multiclean lines, to enable parallel make.  Based on a patch
	by Alexandre Oliva applied to newlib on 2003-10-15.

2004-05-22  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* automake.in (scan_autoconf_traces): Trace for LT_SUPPORTED_TAG
	instead of AC_LIBTOOL_TAGS, since that how CVS Libtool has been
	changed.
	* tests/libtool3.test: Do not grep for --tag=CC, since CVS
	Libtool (unlike Libtool 1.5) does not has any CC tag.

	* tests/tar2.test: Skip the test if no pax archiver were found.

	* NEWS: Sync with branch-1-8, and reorganize current entry.

	* automake.in (handle_libraries): Make the diagnostic about
	non standard libraries a warning in foreign packages.  This
	is already the case in handle_ltlibraries.
	(handle_libraries, handle_ltlibraries): Suggest a standard
	library name in the diagnostic, to help newcomers.
	* tests/stdlib.test, tests/stdlib2.test: Check for these
	suggestions.

	Check directory names for unportable names.  Shaking the code
	to check this also led to the removal of the no-"/"-in-SUBDIRS
	restriction, and a fix to _do_recursive_traversal.

	* automake.in (check_directory): New function extracted from
	handle_subdirs, and augmented to check for reserved W32/DOS name.
	(check_directories_in_var): New function.
	(handle_subdirs): Call check_directories_in_var.  Doing so also
	suppress the restriction that SUBDIRS should not contain slashes.
	(scan_autoconf_traces) <AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR>: Call check_directory
	to ensure the argument exists and is safe.
	* doc/automake.texi (Top level): Do not say that src/subdir
	cannot be put in SUBDIRS.
	(Dist): Mention that distdir and top_distdir can be absolute.
	* lib/Automake/Variable.pm (_do_recursive_traversal) Support
	undefined $fun_collect, and fix two bugs introduced with
	skip_ac_subst on 2004-03-07.
	* lib/am/distdir.am (distdir): Use absolute distdir and
	top_distdir when recursing, because we can no longer prepend only
	`..' in case of SUBDIRS with `/'.
	* tests/auxdir4.test, tests/subdir9.test: New files.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add auxdir4.test.
	* tests/cond2.test, tests/subdir7.test: Augment to check location
	in diagnostics.

2004-05-21  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>  (tiny changes)

	cygwin compatibility.
	* tests/yacc6.test (AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR): Likewise.

	* tests/conflnk3.test: Isolate checking for working `test -e' into
	a subshell, to skip this test on broken /bin/sh of solaris.

2004-05-17  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* m4/cond.m4 (AM_CONDITIONAL): Double-quote diagnostic.
	* tests/condd.test: Define a macro with the same name as a
	conditional.

	contains the macro name.
	Report from Volker Boerchers.

	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add clean2.test.
	Report from Daniel Jacobowitz.

	* aclocal.in (add_macro): Do not error out on undefined required
	macros.  We are not sure they are really used, and Autoconf
	already diagnoses them.
	(scan_configure_dep): Diagnose missing AM_ macros as warnings rather
	than errors.
	* tests/aclocal3.test, tests/ammissing.test: Adjust to expect a
	warning instead of an error.
	* tests/aclocal8.test: AC_REQUIRE an undefined macro in an unused
	macro, and ensure aclocal works anyway.
	* tests/acloca17.test: New file.
	* tests/error.test: Delete, superseded by tests/acloca17.test.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add acloca17.test and remove error.test.

	Fold a few lines to reduce the output by 5 lines.
	Suggested by Karl Berry.

	* automake.in (parse_arguments, MAIN): Give more precise
	diagnostics when no input file is found.
	* tests/output5.test: Adjust.
	Suggested by Jens Petersen.

2004-05-14  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.
	Report from Kevin Ryde.

2004-05-13  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	Adjust to run automake with -Wno-error when the output is expected
	in spite of the error.
	Report from Harlan Stenn.

	* doc/automake.texi (Program and Library Variables): Remove
	doubled word in footnote.

	* automake.in (handle_source_transform): Also check for a
	$(srcdir)/old_source rule when computing the default source name.
	Propagate this $(srcdir) prefix in Automake variables.
	* tests/ltlibsrc.test (noinst_LTLIBRARIES): Explicitly refer to
	$(srcdir)/zoo_d_old2_la.c.  This fixes another failure with BSD Make.

2004-05-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* Makefile.am (fetch): Work even with FreeBSD "make", which
	uses sh -e and thus errors-out if a simple-command fails.
	* lib/am/check.am (check-TESTS): Likewise.
	* lib/am/ltlib.am (clean-%DIR%LTLIBRARIES): Likewise.
	* lib/am/tags.am (TAGS): Likewise.

2004-05-13  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* tests/lex3.test, tests/yacc6.test: Require GNU Make.
	Fixing these for BSD Make requires invasive changes (lexers and
	parsers must be built into $srcdir, and--most annoyingly--all
	references to parse.h must be changed to $(srcdir)/parse.h).
	Report from Mark D. Baushke.

	creates the TAGS file anyway.
	Report from Akim Demaille.

	* lib/depcomp (tru64) [libtool]: Nicolas Joly reported on
	2002-06-12 that dependencies were output in $dir.libs/$base.lo.d.
	Teun Burgers reported on 2004-03-30 they were in

	Coronado).

2004-01-22  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	umask as we did in the past.
	Report from Harlan Stenn.

2004-01-03  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* automake.in (scan_texinfo_file): Do not compare $outfile to ''
	as $outfile might not be defined at all.

	* lib/Automake/Variable.pm (define): Rework the way we check
	Automake variable definition.  Ensure consistent :=/+=/=
	definitions only for variables that have been and are defined by

        Reported by Tom Fitzsimmons.

2004-01-02  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* tests/libtool5.test, tests/ltcond.test, tests/ltcond2.test,
	* tests/ltconv.test: Run automake with --add-missing, because
	the CVS version of libtoolize no longer install config.sub and

	(scan_m4_files): Adjust calls to scan_files.
	(strip_redundant_includes): New function.
	(trace_used_macros): Call it.
	(write_aclocal): Likewise.  Also check the mtime of included files.

	Adjust.
	Suggested by Tom Tromey.

	Do not output .lo rules for programs and static libraries objects,
	and do not output .o/.obj rules for libtool libraries.  This is
	about explicit rules only, not inference rules.
	* automake.in (handle_single_transform_list): Rename as ...
	(handle_single_transform): ... this.  Take a single file
	to transform (it was only called this way) and accept a new
	%transform argument.  Fill %lang_specific_files with list
	references instead of strings, and append %transform to each
	of these lists.
	(define_objects_from_sources, handle_source_transform):
	Take a %transform argument, and forward it to &handle_single_transform.
	(handle_languages): Adjust to the new format of
	%lang_specific_files, and honor its %transform part.
	(handle_programs, handle_libraries, handle_ltlibraries): Override
	%NONLIBTOOL% and %LIBTOOL% while calling handle_source_transform.
	(make_paragraphs): Define %NONLIBTOOL% by default.  Make sure
	%transform settings override global settings.
