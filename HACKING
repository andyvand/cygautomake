= This file

* This file attempts to describe the rules to use when hacking
  automake.

* Don't put this file into the distribution.  Don't mention it in the
  ChangeLog.


= Administrivia

* If you incorporate a change from somebody on the net:
  First, if it is a large change, you must make sure they have signed the
  appropriate paperwork.
  Second, be sure to add their name and email address to THANKS

* If a change fixes a test, mention the test in the ChangeLog entry.

* If somebody reports a new bug, mention his name in the ChangeLog entry
  and in the test case you write.  Put him into THANKS.

* The correct response to most actual bugs is to write a new test case
  which demonstrates the bug.  Then fix the bug, re-run the test suite,
  and check everything in.

* Some files in the automake package are not owned by automake.  These
  files should never be edited here.  These files are COPYING, INSTALL,
  ansi2knr.1, ansi2knr.c, config.guess config.sub, install-sh, mdate-sh,
  missing, mkinstalldirs, texinfo.tex

* Changes other than bug fixes must be mentioned in NEWS


= Editing `.am' files

* Always use $(...) and not ${...}

* Use `:', not `true'.  Use `exit 1', not `false'.


= Editing automake.in and aclocal.in

* Follow existing indentation style.

* Use only Perl 4 constructs


= Test suite

* Use "make check" and "make maintainer-check" liberally

* Make sure each test file is executable
