This is a test release of this package.
Please do not send reports about this release to any
GNU mailing list or newsgroup.

A few notes on this particular release:

* The `missing' program is still not in use.

* The `acinstall' program is distributed but not used; I still must
  write the internal support for it.  This is the program that will be
  used to install macro files for aclocal.

* The documentation needs a lot more work.

Please send comments and problem reports about this test release to
tromey@cygnus.com -- ignore the bug reporting addresses given by the
programs and in the documentation.
