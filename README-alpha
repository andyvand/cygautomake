This is a test release of this package.  Using it more or less
implicitly signs you up to help me find whatever problems you report.

The documentation still needs more work.  Suggestions welcome.
Patches even more welcome.

Please send comments and problem reports about this test release to
bug-automake@gnu.org.  This program will get better only if you report
the problems you encounter.
