This is a test release of this package.
Please do not send reports about this release to any
GNU mailing list or newsgroup.

A few notes on this particular release:

* If upgrading from a previous test release, you must remove all the
  old installed m4 files; their names have changed to fit into the 14
  char limit.  These files are ordinarily in $(prefix)/share/aclocal.

* The `missing' program is still not in use, pending

* The `acinstall' program is distributed but not used; I still must
  write the internal support for it.  This is the program that will be
  used to install macro files for aclocal.

* The documentation needs more work.  For instance the macros that
  come with aclocal are not fully documented.

* Right now the generated Makefiles will print the commands used for
  (eg) installing, no matter how ugly.  These commands give no
  feedback as they do their work.  It has been suggested that these
  command be made invisible (using "@"), and also print something as
  they work (eg "installing foo as /a/b/foo").  I'd appreciate
  feedback on this idea, especially if you have particular reasons for
  preferring one over the other.

Please send comments and problem reports about this test release to
tromey@cygnus.com -- ignore the bug reporting addresses given by the
programs and in the documentation.
