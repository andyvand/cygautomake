A few notes on this particular release:

I'm trying to clean things up for the 1.2 release.  If you know of
serious problems or limitations, please tell me.


A few things that I still haven't gotten to fixing:

* The `acinstall' program is distributed but not used; I still must
  write the internal support for it.  This is the program that will be
  used to install macro files for aclocal.  This probably won't happen
  before 1.2.

* The documentation still needs more work.  Suggestions welcome.

Please send comments and problem reports about this test release to
tromey@cygnus.com -- ignore the bug reporting addresses given by the
programs and in the documentation.
