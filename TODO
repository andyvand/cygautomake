For CONFIG_HEADER,
  generate automatic dependencies for the object files.
  automatically add its input file to the distribution.

For dist files, check all of the common ones and add them to the
distribution if they exist: NEWS, COPYING, INSTALL, ChangeLog, etc.

Deal with optional object files and programs (@foo@) better.
Ditto for programs that are scripts.
Right now it's just kludgy workarounds.

Don't hardcode the name of the configuration header.

Should libexec programs have the name transform done on them?

Order the output rules sensibly, so FOO_SOURCES and FOO_OBJECTS are
together and rules are in the usual order.

Make the output minimal: only output definitions for variables that
are used.

Rewrite in Perl.  Look at dist's jmake for ideas.
