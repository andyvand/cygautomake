Priorities for release:
  [ none ]

!! Must fix require_file stuff.  It is really gross, and I don't
   understand it any more.

!! remove autosystem-specific macros
!! should write autoconf-style doc entries for each m4 macro

should put inverse of @MAINT@ before `.PHONY: configure'.  This means
fixing configure target name (no $srcdir)

* must update GNU Hello

** when can aclocal.m4 be auto-generated?

** many requests for a way to omit a file from the distribution.
   Should be done like `!foo' or `~foo' in _SOURCES, etc.
   Such files should be removed explicitly after the copy step!
   Doing this requires rewriting macros before generating Makefile.in.

add support for Makefile.tmpl that is auto-included in every
Makefile.am.  That makes it easier to do some non-std thing in every
subdirectory.

consider printing full file name of Makefile.am or configure.in when
giving error.  This would help for very large trees with many
configure.in scripts

From the GNU Standards.  These things could be checked, and probably
should be if --gnu.
*    Make sure that the directory into which the distribution unpacks (as
well as any subdirectories) are all world-writable (octal mode 777).
*   Make sure that no file name in the distribution is more than 14
characters long.
*    Don't include any symbolic links in the distribution itself.
*    Make sure that all the files in the distribution are world-readable.

consider supporting "var+= stuff" syntax.  rewrite to just var=... on
output.  This is sometimes convenient when you want to write a
Makefile.am in more-or-less modular parts

should be able to determine what is built by looking at rules (and
configure.in).  Then built man pages (eg) could automatically be
omitted from the distribution.

Consider using libfoo_SOURCES, etc, for libraries.  From Gord
Matzigkeit.  There is a patch.

Idea from Joerg-Martin Schwarz: allow passing different -D flags to
different compiles.  This can be done, but with the restriction that a
.c cannot appear in 2 different "objects" (programs/libraries)
compiled with different -D options (because -c and -o do not always
work together and parallel makes must work).  This could be
implemented by noticing whenever a ".o" target with no rules is being
emitted, and adding the appropriate compilation rule as appropriate.
This should work with targets from Makefile.am as well as from .P
files, which means rewriting so that the Makefile.am contents aren't
copied into the output immediately.  This feature is probably required
to fully support libtool ("grody compilation issue")

Henrik Frystyk Nielsen says:
Henrik> 4) Flags like --include-deps are lost when you make changes to
Henrik> Makefile.am files and automake is run automatically. It would
Henrik> be nice to keep these flags as I now have to redo everything
Henrik> manually.
... what about other options here too?

Think about: maybe "make check" should just bomb if error occurs?
Then user must use "make -k check".  This is probably more natural.

Consider: "cvs" option adds some cvs-specific rules?

"Cygnus"-specific features:
* An option that statically rewrites @MAINT@ to "#M#".
* Should look for certain tools in the build tree:
  expect, dejagnu, makeinfo
* `no-installinfo' is the default
* always generate `info' and `install-info' targets
* Allow `texinfo.tex' to be missing

Automake: should EXTRA_DIST files be statically findable?

Automake: devo/inet/Makefile.am has "all-local".  "install" depends on
"all", but the local installs get run before the stuff in "all".  Gross.

Right now, targets generated internally (eg "install") are not
overridable by user code.  This should probably be possible, even
though it isn't very important.  This could be done by generating all
internal rules via a function call instead of just appending to
$output_rules.

* Should be a way to have "nobuild_PROGRAMS" which aren't even built,
  but which could be by running the magic make command.

* Should have tool like "autoreconf" that only remakes Makefiles that
  need it.  Probably autoreconf should be modified to handle automake

Other priorities:
* Must rewrite am_install_var.  Should break into multiple functions.
  This will allow the callers to be a little smarter.
* Rewrite clean targets.
* Must rewrite error handling code.  Right now it is a real mess
  Should fix up require_file junk at the same time

Things to finish libtool support:
* Handle grody compilation issue
* Handle install changes
* Handle clean changes
* New definition for LINK

Scan source directories and warn about missing files, eg .c/.h files
that aren't mentioned?

Need way to say there are no suffixes in a Makefile (Franc,ois'
"override" idea suffices here)

Check to make sure various scripts are executable (IE when looking for
them in a directory)

Use recode in dist target when MAINT_CHARSET specified.  Read caveats
in automake.in before doing this.  Note the same problem used to apply
to the no-dependencies option; maybe it still should?  Note also that
each Makefile.am must be rewritten at "make dist" time if
MAINT_CHARSET and DIST_CHARSET are not identical.  NOTE: gettext must
arrange for all .po files not to be recoded.  In the long term this
might be a problem (consider when some systems use Unicode but the
rest do not)
  MAINT_CHARSET *must* be local to each Makefile.am, to enable
	merged distributions.
  DIST_CHARSET must be passed down to subdir makes during a "make dist"

Handle dist-zoo.  Generally add more DOS support.  Maybe run "doschk"
(why isn't this merged with "pathchk"?) when doing a dist.  Do
whatever else François says here...

Add support for html via an option.  Use texi2html.  Use
"html_TEXINFOS", and htmldir = .../html.  Include html files in
distribution.  Also allow "html_DATA", for raw .html files.
  [ when will texinfo support html? ]
  [ is there a texinfo.tex that supports texi2html extensions? ]

uninstall and pkg-dirs should rm -rf the dir.

a potential bug: configure puts "blah.o" into LIBOBJS, thus implying
these files can't be de-ansified.  Not a problem?

In general most .am files should be merged into automake.  For
instance all the "clean" targets could be merged by keeping lists of
things to be removed.  This would be a lot nicer looking.  Note that
the install targets probably should not be merged; it is sometimes
useful to only install a small part.

Clean up the output:
* Order rules sensibly
* Ensure every line has a purpose.  Omit unused stuff
* Eliminate extraneous rules when possible (eg 'install-am' stuff)
* Make sure vertical spacing is correct
* pretty-print targets
* regularize how backslash-newline is done.  Just one space between text
  and backslash should be the rule.  Update makefile-mode to allow this.
  (set column to 0, probably)
Omit program transform vars from header if no program installed.  This
is currently pretty hard to do.  (But with beautification code it
would probably be easy)

Lex, yacc support:
* It would be nice to automatically support using bison's better features
  to rename the output files.  This requires autoconf support
* Consider supporting syntax from autoconf "derived:source", eg:
	y.tab.c:perly.y
  for yacc and lex source
* if AC_PROG_LEX used, ensure (no, *PUT*) LEXLIB in foo_LDADD

Multi-language support:
* should have mapping of file extensions to languages
* should automatically handle the linking issue (special-case C++)
* must get compile rules for various languages; FORTRAN probably
  most important unimplemented language

'maintainer-clean' should "rm -rf .deps".  Ditto distclean
Should look for clean-local targets in Makefile.am.

It might be cool to generate .texi dependencies by grepping for
@include.  (If done, it should be done the same way C dependencies are
done)

It would be good to check some parts of GNU standards.  Already check
for install-sh and mkinstalldirs.  What else is required to be in
package by GNU standards or by automake?
Some things for --strictness=gnits:
* "cd $(foo); something" is an error in a rule.  Should be:
  "cd $(foo) && something"
* Look for 'ln -s' and warn about using $(LN) and AC_PROG_LN_S
* Look for $(LN) and require AC_PROG_LN_S

automake.in: should ".cc" really -> "$o"?  This doesn't really seem
right, but maybe it is so names can be rewritten uniformly?  Must
check

Auto-distribute "ChangeLog.[0-9]+"?  "ChangeLog.[a-z]+"?

Internationalize. [ gettext doesn't have the necessary machinery yet ]
am_error should use printf-style arguments (for eventual gettext scheme)

François says the ordering of files in a distribution should be as follows:
* README
* source files
* derived files
I agree, but I don't see how to implement this yet.
It might be easier if "derived files" is limited to those that
Automake itself knows about, eg output of yacc.

Check all source files to make sure that FSF address is up-to-date.
--gnits or --gnu only.

Merge each -vars.am file with corresponding ".am" file.  Can do this
because of changes to &file_contents.

Looked at a program called 'ezmake', which seems to do something
similar.  The only idea there that is possibly worth stealing is using
globs in definitions.  Also has negations.  Eg in a directory with
files a.c, b.c and c.c, the line:
	foo_SOURCES = *.c ~c.c
would be equivalent to:
	foo_SOURCES = a.c b.c
Is this worth implementing?

Should libexec programs have the name transform done on them?

Order the output rules sensibly, so FOO_SOURCES and FOO_OBJECTS are
together and rules are in the usual order.

Make the output minimal: only output definitions for variables that
are used.

Look at dist's jmake for ideas.  dist is the name of the distribution
including Metaconfig.  Perl uses it.

Should handle directory hierarchies deeper than 2.  Right now there is
some support for this.  Here are some of the issues:
* Should handle AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS, ie must handle configure.in in subdirs
    * can do this by looking at subdirs, seeing configure.in
      and auto-running Automake there

dejagnu support:
* use RUNTEST_FOR_TARGET in some cases?

These can both be handled via dist-hook:
. Consider supporting guile-style PLUGIN directories automatically?
. Consider allowing eg "foo/bar" to appear in EXTRA_DIST, and generating
  code to make directory foo at dist time

consider having no-gzip option that turns off gzip/GNU tar.

djm says:

David> the middle of a Makefile.in, how about pushing comments that
David> start with ### to the top of the Makefile.in (in order)?  Sort

David> code to the top of configure.

Janos Farkas says:
 suidbins = su
 suidubins = chage cfhn etc etc
 noinst_PROGRAMS = grpconv pwconv id groups $(suidbins) $(suidubins)
... should work.

Karl Berry says:
Karl> 2) Your Makefile variable names are generally uppercase, but GNU
Karl> generally uses lowercase. Not that it matters :-).

================================================================

Stuff for aclocal:

probably should put each group of m4 files into a subdir owned by the
containing application.

must fill in definitions for some of the AC_FEATURE macros

consider including autosystem; that is the only way the AC_FEATURE
macros even make sense.  Or move the AC_FEATURE macros back into
autosystem...

================================================================

Document:

go through handle_configure and make sure each macro is documented in
the appropriate place.  Clean up ordering in document.  Add info about
AM_ macros.

finish yacc, lex, c++ nodes

Document customary ordering of Makefile.am.  From François.

must document that @ALLOCA@ works in _LDADD

Must document BUILT_SOURCES variable.  See depend.am.

Should include extended version of diagram from Autoconf (suggested by
Greg Woods)

Document gettext support

Make a definition of the term "source"

need xref to libtool in docs

document how to use Automake with CVS.  Idea from Mark Galassi.  Also
include Greg Woods' more sophisticated "cvs-dist" target.

document rebuilding configure.  CONFIGURE_DEPENDENCIES

document new variables introduced when AC_CANONICAL_* used

document canonicalization for texinfos

automake must be run in each directory with a configure.in
This is insufficiently clear

must document the targets required for integration with
non-automake-using subdirs

document actual uses of PACKAGE and VERSION

Must document aclocal program

djm says:
David> A list of autoconf macros that can be required for use with
David> automake, all in one place, would be helpful.

document *not* putting config.h into _SOURCES

document variable scanning: $() and ${} interpolation


================================================================

Libraries:

* Should support standalone library along with subdir library in same
  Makefile.am.  Maybe: turn off "standalone" mode if library's Makefile.am
  is not only one specd? [ add an option for this ]

================================================================

Longer term:

Have a program that generates a Makefile on stdout, passes it through
a "config.status"-style filter, and thence into make.  Why bother,
other than the gee-whiz factor?

It might be interesting to figure out how a GNU system could use
Makefile.am's without resorting to Automake.  This might be impossible
in a practical sense.

Would it be useful to integrate in some way with the Debian package
building utility?  Must check.  maybe it would be possible to deal
with all the different package utilities somehow.  Lately I've been
hearing good things about the RedHat packaging utilities.  Why are
there so many of these?  Are they fun to write or something?
The RedHat package utility is called RPM; see
	ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/code/rpm
It actually has problems, like no configure script and no documentation.

================================================================

A tool to guess what the local Makefile.am should look like:

* Probably integrate with autoscan
* Use various simple rules to determine what to do:
  * get name of top directory, sans version info
  * search for .c files with 'main' in them
    * if in main.c, use directory name for program
    * if in more than one, generate multiple programs
    * if not found, generate a library named after directory
  * order subdir searches correctly: lib first, src last
  * assume 'testsuite' dir means we are using dejagnu
* maybe be smart about reading existing Makefile.am, so tool
  can be run for incremental changes?  You could imagine:

	Makefile.am:
		autoproject --incremental

================================================================

Stuff NOT to do, and why:

consider auto-including any file that matches "*.in".
  [ no: po/Makefile.in shouldn't be included ]

must look at mkid to see how it works (for subdir usage)
  [ right now, it doesn't.  i don't see a simple fix right now ]

if configure.in not found, move up a directory and try again?  This
could eliminate a common source of problems.
  [ this is just a bad idea ]

* scripts are installed in $exec_prefix/bin, not $prefix/bin
  Bug or feature?
  [ the consensus on Gnits is that this isn't required.
    doubters can work around it anyway ]

* make the auto-dep code crash if GNU make not in use?
  (doesn't it already?)
