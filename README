This is AutoMake, an experimental Makefile generator.  It was inspired
by the 4.4BSD make and include files, but aims to be portable and to
conform to the GNU standards for Makefile variables and targets.

It's a preprocessor shell script.  The input files are called
Makefile.am and the output files are called Makefile.in, which are
suitable for use with Autoconf.

Variable assignment lines in the input Makefile.am pull in defaults
from various little *.am files.

To use AutoMake, replace your Makefile.in files with Makefile.am
files.  Since there's no documentation, look at the automake script
and the examples provided for GNU m4 1.3 and fileutils 3.9 (along with
patches you need to apply to those packages).

AutoMake is just a prototype at this point -- expect omissions and bugs.
